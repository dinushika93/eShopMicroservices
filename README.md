Overview

This repository is a  collection of microserervices that simulates the components of a basic e-shopping web Application.

The architecture presents a simplified microservice-oriented design, featuring multiple autonomous microservicesâ€”each owning its own data/database. The solution is a reimplemnation of a well-known domain, so the main goal is to explores different implementation patterns across the services(Vertcalslice architecture vs DDD/Clean architecture)
