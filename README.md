## Overview

This repository contains a collection of microservices that simulate the core components of a basic e-shopping web application.

The architecture demonstrates a simplified microservice-oriented design, where each service operates autonomously and owns its own dedicated database.Each service and its corresponding database are hosted in independent Docker containers, to enable isolated development and deployment.

The main objective of this solution is to demonstrate various implementation patterns across the services — including Vertical Slice Architecture, DDD, and Clean Architecture — along with their communication and integration.
