##Overview

This repository contains a collection of microservices that simulate the core components of a basic e-shopping web application.

The architecture demonstrates a simplified microservice-oriented design, where each service operates autonomously and owns its own dedicated database.Each service and its corresponding database are hosted in independent Docker containers, to enable isolated development and deployment.

The primary goal of this solution is to explore different implementation patterns across services — such as Vertical Slice Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture — within a familiar e-commerce domain.
